In the existing call center dataset we have 12 columns that include, the id, customer name, sentiment, city, reason, etc. So we are going to write the 12 columns in our database so it will be match with the existing call center dataset. Make sure to write the columns sequentially according to the call center datasets as the existing data. \n",
